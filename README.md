## Overview
I have improved confident that I can code on my self without getting help from tutorials. I need to do it more to become professional website developer.

Users should be able to:

- Code as the same design as possible.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

A div can be centered with position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%).
- All contents should be inside landmark rather than a section.
- a page should include one main landmark
- block elements should not be included in span because span is an inline element. use instead div.


```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I am still having struggle to code on my own without tutorials. I need to practice like this one to overcome the challenge I'm struggling.
